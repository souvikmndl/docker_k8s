client-pod file:
-----------------------------------
- With these k8s config files, we dont exactly create containers. We create objects.
- Some example of object types(referred with the keyword "kind" in the.yaml files):
    - StatefulSet
    - ReplicaController
    - Pod 
    - Service 
- Each of these types serve a specific purpose, like Pod is used to run a container 
- Service type object is used to setup networking, etc
- apiVersion: a certain apiVersion gives us access to certain types of objects 
- In K8s, we create a VM or a node, inside which we will have a Pod which will have one/more containers
- The containers we group inside a pod must be tightly coupled, meaning they must be very integral
- to each other, like say a DB, a DB logger and a Backup Manager. 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: client-pod
    labels:
        component: web --> acts as a selector
spec:
    containers: --> list of containers we will run inside this pod 
        - name: client --> name of the pod, for reference, logging and networking like in docker compose 
          image: stephengrider/multi-client --> docker image to pull
          ports: --> this is the port we will expose to the outside world. But its not the entire config
              - containerPort: 3000 --> it was the port used in docker image by nginx. 
=======================================================================================
client-node-port.yaml (Service type)
- Service type objects are used for networking purposes 
- there are 4 types of services:
    - ClusterIP 
    - NodePort (exposes a port to the outside world, used only for dev purposes)
    - LoadBalancer
    - Ingress

spec:
    type: NodePort
    ports:
        - port: 3050 --> used for internal networking, another pod in the same node can connect using this
          targetPort: 3000 -->  port inside pod that we are exposing to the world
          nodePort: 31515 --> this is the port we use on our local machine to access targetPort
          (must always be between 30000-32767)
    selector:
        component: web --> tell this svc obj to look for all containers with key value pair of 
(component,web). This is connected to metadata.labels of the client-pod.yaml. Note that both 
component and web are arbitrary, both of them could have been any other words
